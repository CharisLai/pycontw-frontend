        intro: 'Young Inspirers is a new activity started from PyCon Taiwan 2021, aiming to create a learning and communication space for young people. We would like to encourage young people to share their experiences, and cultivate the ability of multi-thinking to exchange information between different generations. In PyCon APAC 2022, we will invite student speakers located in the APAC area. Through these sharing sessions, we look forward to seeing more and more young inspirers get involved in the community.',
        formTitle: 'Event This Year',
        form: 'This year the format of Young Inspirers will be different: The entire event will be streamed live on YouTube. The sharing of each speaker consists of approximately 30 minutes of pre-recorded interviews with the speakers, followed by 10 minutes of Live Q&A. The speakers will interact with the audience during Live Q&A sessions.',

The Hour of Code community provided me with the first resources I had to learn Python and STEM knowledge with, such as book recommendations and learning sites. Through the Internet, books, online documentations, learning sites and especially talks from peers and experts with experience in Python, I started to learn to make small projects and games with packages such as Tkinter and Turtle, which I’d share with others and get feedback from. Slowly, I began to develop a deep interest and passion for learning programming and for coding Python, a passion that I still have today. The more I learn about Python, the more I discover the infinite possibilities and projects I can create with it. Python is a popular language with a lot of potential for usage in machine learning and data science, and I hope to continue learning more and experimenting more on using Python in those fields and packages designed for those purposes, such as Tensorflow and Pandas, in the future.',
