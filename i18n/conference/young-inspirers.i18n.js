        intro: 'Young Inspirers is a new activity started from PyCon Taiwan 2021, aiming to create a learning and communication space for young people. We would like to encourage young people to share their experiences, and cultivate the ability of multi-thinking to exchange information between different generations. In PyCon APAC 2022, we will invite student speakers located in the APAC area. Through these sharing sessions, we look forward to seeing more and more young inspirers get involved in the community.',
        form: 'This year the format of Young Inspirers will be different: The entire event will be streamed live on YouTube. The sharing of each speaker consists of approximately 30 minutes of pre-recorded interviews with the speakers, followed by 10 minutes of Live Q&A. The speakers will interact with the audience during Live Q&A sessions.',

                    'In this talk, I wish to share my Python learning journey from the beginning, when I did not know how to code, and to inspire other young people who are starting out or wish to start. Free courses, workshops and online platforms, competitions all helped me out when I began my journey, and I also hope to share about what made me pursue a learning path in Python and in programming as well as my plans for my learning path, such as learning about machine learning and vision AI. Coding is an essential skill in the future as it is an important part of the digital transformation. It can possibly change the world by changing the way we live and complete tasks more efficiently. Thus, through this sharing, I wish to inspire young people like myself in the past who want to start but do not know where as well as offer tips on problem solving, advice on setting learning goals, and helpful information such as useful learning platforms for them so that they too can learn this essential skill.',
