In this talk, we will explore the basics of audio processing using Python from a data science perspective. We will discuss the characteristics of time-domain data, important mathematical tools, and artificial intelligence related to audio. Additionally, we will focus on how to use these tools to handle complex musical and biological signals. Finally, we aim to present the multifaceted nature of contemporary music AI research, covering applications from music generation and human-computer interaction in music to the study of musical cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nSince most current AI applications focus on text and image processing, I believe there will be significant interest in the applications and principles of audio processing. Through this talk, we hope to introduce what can be achieved with Python in audio processing and music AI, and to share personal insights on using Python as a research tool.";q.slides=a;r.linkedin=a;r.twitter=a;r.github=a;return {data:[{keynotesData:[{id:"afb391de-7a15-494e-a137-b9de64a1df81",speaker:b,session:e,slido:a,hackmd_embed_link:a,youtube_id:a,social_item:h},{id:"970fbc0e-73f6-4df4-be86-54286bcc857f",speaker:i,session:l,slido:a,hackmd_embed_link:a,youtube_id:a,social_item:o},{id:"70fec666-28a8-412c-b471-9fcf8cda7af7",speaker:p,session:q,slido:a,hackmd_embed_link:a,youtube_id:a,social_item:r}]}],fetch:{},mutations:[["setKeynotesData",[{id:30,speaker:b,session:e,slido:a,hackmd_embed_link:a,youtube_id:a,social_item:h},{id:31,speaker:i,session:l,slido:a,hackmd_embed_link:a,youtube_id:a,social_item:o},{id:32,speaker:p,session:q,slido:a,hackmd_embed_link:a,youtube_id:a,social_item:r}]]]}}("",{},"Georgi Ker","Georgi Ker is the Director and a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation. She is a co-organizer of PyLadiesCon and the co-founder of PyLadies Bangkok. A French citizen born and raised in Singapore, Georgi has also lived in Thailand and Indonesia before relocating to Amsterdam, the Netherlands. During her time in Thailand, she served as the conference lead for PyCon APAC and PyCon Thailand.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorgi is an avid advocate for Diversity & Inclusion. She co-chairs the D&I Workgroup within the PSF and has launched the podcast series \"The Hidden Figures of Python\" alongside hosts Mariatta Wijaya, Cheuk Ting Ho, and Tereza Iofciu. The podcast aims to highlight stories from underrepresented groups within the Python community.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn autodidact polymath who speaks multiple languages, Georgi currently runs her own branding and visual studio. Some of the projects include TV series Strange Girl in Strange Land, PyCon US (2022-2024), Proof of Talk and PyData London.",{},"From Local Roots to Global Impact: Why Your Presence Matters to the Community","In this talk, we will explore the profound impact that individual contributions can have on both local and global communities within the tech ecosystem. Drawing from my own journey—from grassroots involvement in local Python groups to significant roles in international conferences and the Python Software Foundation—I will illustrate how each step has shaped my understanding of community and collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe will delve into the significance of diversity and inclusion and why these elements are essential for fostering the growth of the community, particularly in the APAC region.\r\n\r\nThrough practical examples and actionable insights, this talk will provide guidance on how to leverage your unique skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact. Whether you're just starting out or are a seasoned community leader, you’ll come away with a deeper appreciation of why your presence matters, how you can contribute to building a stronger community, and how this can impact your life and career.\r\n\r\nBy highlighting stories of personal experiences, I aim to inspire attendees to recognize their potential to drive change, no matter the scale of their current involvement.",{},{},"Seth Michael Larson","Seth Larson is the inaugural Security Developer-in-Residence at the Python Software Foundation. He works to secure the supply chain and improve the security posture of CPython and projects in the Python packaging ecosystem. Seth also maintains a handful of open source Python projects like urllib3, requests, truststore. Seth is a fellow of the Python Software Foundation.",{},"Bytes, Pipes, and People","The majority of software today uses open source components like Python and projects on the Python Package Index. The ubiquity of open source software hasn’t gone unnoticed, there are new threats looking to exploit open source projects to achieve their goals. In this talk we’ll learn about these threats to the software supply chain, the efforts to thwart them, and the steps we can take to keep the Python ecosystem safe for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this talk is to describe the current threat landscape for open source projects like CPython and packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI), and what recent projects have done to mitigate these threats. My second year as Security Developer-in-Residence will be focusing on improving the security posture of the ecosystem of Python packages and the downstream users who consume those projects, so this keynote will cover that work along with any announcements, achievements, etc. I plan on weaving my background and experience with internet technology and security into the narrative of supply chain security.",{},{},{},{})));
